# Gezgin

The collective geographic photo album where you post, share and trade your photos


## The album

With Gezgin, you pin photos to your current location permanently. Each location can have only one photo. 
If someone else has already posted there, you have to move to find an empty spot to post yours. 


## Roadmap

2021 Q4 - Community building
- Social features: post, share & like photos
- Earn Gezgin tokens by posting photos and completing streaks

2022 Q1 - In-community trading
- Buy photos with Gezgin tokens

2022 Q2 - Onchain trading
- Trade your photos as NFTs


## Tokenomics
Total number of photo grids;
- globally ≈ 1 trillion
- in habitable areas ≈ 200 billion
- in urban areas ≈ 2 billion

Excluding the private and restricted access areas, a total of around 100 million photos is expected to be in the album finally. 
The creation of photo posts will get harder in time as easily accessible locations will be occupied first. 

When a photo post is sold, the revenue will be split between the owner and the community. 
- 40% to the photo owner
- 40% to the whole community
- 20% to the Gezgin team to be spent on expenses

For in-community purchases made by Gezgin tokens, the community share will be burnt. 

Following the launch of NFT sales, the value of 1 Gezgin token will be calculated as:
- Total $ in the community vault / Total number of tokens held by the community members
